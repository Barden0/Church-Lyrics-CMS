# SONG: MORE
More and more of You Lord | I thirst for more of Your grace
I thirst for more and more | More of what You do
I thirst for more and more | More of what You say
I thirst for more and more | More of the nations of the world
Of the peoples of the world |
More and more | More and more of You

# SONG: AS YOU FILL OUR HEARTS
Every time that we gather in Your name | You are here in us by Your Spirit
As we lift our voice in worship and praise | Lord we open our hearts to You
As You fill our hearts | With Your passion and Your dreams
With hunger to see Your glory fill the earth |
You fill our hearts | With Your purpose and plans
Oh Jesus | It's by Your Spirit
We yield our hearts to You | With no resistance at all
You are the builder Lord | And we are Your edifice
Feeble hearts strengthened | Burn with fresh fire

# SONG: CAN YOU FEEL THE RAIN
Can you feel the rain rain rain rain rain | Supernatural rain pouring out
Great demonstration of our God mighty hand | Filling hungry hearts to overflow
I believe and I receive | Everything You have for me today
No holding back, no stereotypes Lord | I choose to be drenched in Your rain

# SONG: WHAT IS MAN
What is man | Your workmanship designed to depend on You
What is man | One designed to rely on Your grace
What is life without You | What is time not spent for You
Oh Jesus I desire You | My praise starts and ends with You
When the music fades away | My focus remains You
When the cheers are all gone | Oh Jesus I'll still hold on
